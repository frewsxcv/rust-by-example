The `panic!` macro can be used to generate a *task* panic and start unwinding
its stack. While unwinding, the runtime will take care of freeing all the
resources *owned* by the task by calling the destructor of all its objects.

Since we are dealing with programs with only one task, `panic!` will cause the
program to report the panic message and exit.

{panic.play}

Let's check that `panic!` doesn't leak memory.

```
